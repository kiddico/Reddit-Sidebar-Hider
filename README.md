####a simple chrome extension to toggle the reddit sidebar

You know what I think is dumb? Then you have a small screen and you want to go on reddit and not hate life. But you get to reddit, and you hate life cause you can't actually do anything. Well you can, you just get a sliver of your own screen. The rest is owned by the all powerfull sidebar. Screw the sidebar. I hate it. Unless I need it. Then I love it. Why not both?
Well this is both. This chrome extension is a simple sidebar hider for reddit.
It's pretty easy to grasp. You hit the button, and hte sidebar goes away. You git it again, and it comes back. Simple.

If you don't feel like running your browser in developer mode I put a pre-packaged crx in the packaged folder. Just drag it into your extensions window... thing.
