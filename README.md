##<center>Reddit Sidebar Hider </center>
####a simple chrome extension to toggle the reddit sidebar
You know what I think is dumb? When you have a small screen and you want to go on reddit and not hate life. But you get to reddit, and you hate life cause you can't actually do anything. Well you can, you just get a sliver of your own screen. The rest is owned by the all powerfull sidebar. Screw the sidebar. I hate it. Unless I need it. Then I love it. Why not both?

Well this is both. This chrome extension is a simple sidebar hider for reddit.

It's pretty easy to grasp. You hit the button, and the sidebar goes away. You hit it again, and it comes back. I'll give you a moment to scrape your brain off the wall behind you.

### "How do I get the thing?" - You, 2016

Well, you've got 3 options. (I would stick to #1 if I were you)

1. Get it from the chrome web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-sidebar-hider/aipfmjljjkiepeocilaillicdohnkehp?hl=en&gl=US).
2. Get the latest pre-packaged .crx file from [here](https://github.com/kiddico/Reddit-Sidebar-Hider/tree/master/packaged/current).
3. Or clone this repo to your computer, enable developer mode in your browser settings, and click the load unpacked extension button. Then navigate to, and select the developement folder in the cloned folder.

Todo:

* Start developing a Firefox Solution.
	* Alternatively focus on a cross platform implementation using the WebExtensions API.
* Reduce or remove initial delay of sidebar removal on pageload.
* actually have users.
