##<center>Reddit Sidebar Hider </center>
####a simple chrome extension to toggle the reddit sidebar
You know what I think is dumb? When you have a small screen and you want to go on reddit and not hate life. But you get to reddit, and you hate life cause you can't actually do anything. Well you can, you just get a sliver of your own screen. The rest is owned by the all powerfull sidebar. Screw the sidebar. I hate it. Unless I need it. Then I love it. Why not both?

Well this is both. This chrome extension is a simple sidebar hider for reddit.

It's pretty easy to grasp. You hit the button, and the sidebar goes away. You hit it again, and it comes back. I'll give you a moment to scrape your brain off the wall behind you.

### "How do I get the thing?" - You, 2016

#### Chrome
Well, you've got 3 options. (I would stick to #1 if I were you)

1. Get it from the chrome web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-sidebar-hider/aipfmjljjkiepeocilaillicdohnkehp?hl=en&gl=US).
2. Get the latest pre-packaged .crx file from [here](https://github.com/kiddico/Reddit-Sidebar-Hider/tree/master/packaged/current).
3. Or clone this repo to your computer, enable developer mode in your browser settings, and click the load unpacked extension button. Then navigate to, and select the developement folder in the cloned folder.

---

#### Firefox
If you're a firefox user the only option right now is to download it through the firefox store thingy. If the store won't work for you well, that sucks, cause it's the only option. Mozilla doesn't like it when people play with their toys so you need to install a special edition of firefox, and bla bla bla. Just use the store.

You can get it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-sidebar-getter-ridder/).

Todo:

* Reduce or remove initial delay of sidebar removal on pageload.
* Opera support anyone? Safari? Maybe.
