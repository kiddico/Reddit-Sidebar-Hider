####a simple chrome extension to toggle the reddit sidebar

You know what I think is dumb? When you have a small screen and you want to go on reddit and not hate life. But you get to reddit, and you hate life cause you can't actually do anything. Well you can, you just get a sliver of your own screen. The rest is owned by the all powerfull sidebar. Screw the sidebar. I hate it. Unless I need it. Then I love it. Why not both?

Well this is both. This chrome extension is a simple sidebar hider for reddit.

It's pretty easy to grasp. You hit the button, and the sidebar goes away. You hit it again, and it comes back. I'll give you a moment to scrape your brain off the wall behind you.

If you don't feel like running your browser in developer mode I put a pre-packaged crx in the packaged folder. Just drag it into your extensions window... thing.


Still working on the delay thing. And by that I mean I've given up on it cause it does what I need for now. But if someone has a suggestion for a solution I'll listen. Even if someone wants to make it happen, I'll accept a pull request.
