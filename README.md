##Reddit Sidebar Hider ![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiddico/Reddit-Sidebar-Hider/master/images/reddit_64.png)
####a simple chrome extension to toggle the reddit sidebar

Several people have said that the reason no one has made one of these yet is because it'll block the ads, and reddit won't get ad revenue blah blah blah. Well the page is still loaded in fully, which I'm fairly not confident at all but will still say so on the internet that it will still count as a page view, and therefor an ad impression. Someone should probably double check. I have no idea how these computer things work.

I just realized it says I need to see your activity history or something like that. That's the category the "tabs" API is in, which I need to see which window you're currently looking at. Oh well. Maybe I'll find a better way to do it sometime.

If you don't feel like running your browser in developer mode I put a pre-packaged crx in the packaged folder. Just drag it into your extensions window... thing.

  * border expands / hides the sidebar
