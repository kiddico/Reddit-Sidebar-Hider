	This is a simple chrome extension to toggle the sidebar on reddit.

	Several people have said that the reason no one has made one of these yet is because it'll block the ads. So using it is kind of cruel to the site. So I suppose if you want to be morally safe don't use it.

	...but if you're like me, and you use an ad blocker anyways then I don't see how that matters.
